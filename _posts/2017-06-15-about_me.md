Hi, I'm a PhD student in Machine Learning at
<a href="https://www.irit.fr/?lang=en">IRIT</a> lab, France. I'm also the main
developer of <a href="http://surpriselib.com/">Surprise</a>, an open source
Python library for building recommender systems.

<br>
In a near future (summer 2017), I'll be looking for a job. If you want to know
more about me, please check out my

I have recently been working on Pygbm in collaboration with [Olivier
Grisel](http://ogrisel.com/). Pygbm is a fast, pure-Python implementation of
Gradient Boosting Decision Trees. We're using
[Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) to perform Just In Time compilation.

Our implementation is heavily inspired from that of
[LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM), written in C++.

Check out [Pygbm](https://github.com/ogrisel/pygbm/) GitHub page for more
info!

Hi, I'm Nicolas! 

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Data Science
Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University in New
York. My work is mainly focused on contributing to the
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) library.

I developed (and now maintain) [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com), a Python
library to build and analyze recommender systems.

I got my PhD in Machine Learning from <a
href="https://www.irit.fr/?lang=en">IRIT</a> lab in Toulouse, France.  The goal
of my PhD was to study the empirical behaviour of analogical classifiers
(somewhat related to k-NN classifiers) and to exhibit some of their theoretical
properties. My supervisors were [Henri
Prade](https://www.irit.fr/~Henri.Prade/), [Gilles
Richard](https://www.irit.fr/~Gilles.Richard/), and Mathieu Serrurier. Two of
my main publications so far are:
- [ECAI'16](http://www.ecai2016.org/): [Analogical Classifiers: A Theoretical
  Perspective](http://ebooks.iospress.com/volumearticle/44815).
- [IJCAI'17](http://ijcai-17.org): [Analogy-preserving functions: A way to
  extend Boolean samples](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/218).
- [IJCAI'18](http://www.ijcai-18.org/): [Behavior of Analogical Inference
  w.r.t.  Boolean Functions](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/284).

During my free time, you may find me rock climbing or hiking, lost somewhere in
the Pyrénées (French mountains)... I always enjoy any kind of outdoor activity,
which is quite fortunate given one of my other passions: food!

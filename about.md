Hi, I'm Nicolas!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Data Science
Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University in New
York. My work is mainly focused on contributing to the
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) library.

I am currently having fun on [pygbm](https://github.com/ogrisel/pygbm/), a
fast pure-Python Gradient Boosting Decision Trees implementation, with
Numba's JIT compilation.

During my PhD ([link](http://nicolas-hug.com/assets/phd.pdf)) I developed
(and now maintain) [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com), a Python library to
build and analyze recommender systems.

During my free time, you may find me rock climbing or hiking, lost somewhere in
the Pyrénées (French mountains)... I always enjoy any kind of outdoor activity,
which is quite fortunate given one of my other passions: food!

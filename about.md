Hi, I'm Nicolas!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Data Science
Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University in New
York, in [Andreas MÃ¼ller](https://amueller.github.io/)'s team.

My work is mainly focused on maintaining and contributing to the
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) library. I try to build software
for democratizing machine learning.

During my PhD ([link](http://nicolas-hug.com/assets/phd.pdf)) I developed
(and now maintain) [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com), a Python library to
build and analyze recommender systems.

I love eating, climbing, hiking, eating (again), and coding.

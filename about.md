Hi, I'm Nicolas!
(This picture is a million years old.)

I like to develop open source software for machine learning.

I'm currently working at Facebook AI in London, where I focus on
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and more specifically on
[TorchVision](https://pytorch.org/vision/). Prior to that, I was working in
New York at Columbia University, where I was maintaining and contributing to
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). During my PhD
([link](http://nicolas-hug.com/assets/phd.pdf)) I developed (and now
maintain) [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com), a Python library to build and
analyze recommender systems.

In the [blog section]({{ site.url }}/blog), I try to write about stuff that
took me way too long to understand. During my free time I like to climb stuff
and eat cheese.

Here is my (often outdated) [résumé]({{ site.url }}/assets/Nicolas_Hug_CV.pdf).

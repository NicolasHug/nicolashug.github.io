Hi, I'm Nicolas!

I'm an associate research scientist at the [Data Science
Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University in New
York, in [Andreas Müller](https://amueller.github.io/)'s team.

My work is mainly focused on maintaining and contributing to the
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) library. I try to build software
for democratizing machine learning.

During my PhD ([link](http://nicolas-hug.com/assets/phd.pdf)) I developed
(and now maintain) [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com), a Python library to
build and analyze recommender systems.

In the [blog section]({{ site.url }}/blog), I try to write about stuff that
took me way too long to understand.

I love eating, rock climbing, hiking, eating (again), and coding.

Here is my (probably outdated) [résumé]({{ site.url
}}/assets/Nicolas_Hug_CV.pdf).

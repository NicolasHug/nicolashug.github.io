Hi, I'm a PhD student in Machine Learning at
[IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/?lang=en) lab, France.

The main goal of my PhD is to study the practical and
[theoretical](http://ebooks.iospress.com/volumearticle/44815) behaviour of
[analogical classifiers](http://ijcai.org/Proceedings/07/Papers/108.pdf).

I'm also the main developer of [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/), an open
source Python library for building recommender systems.

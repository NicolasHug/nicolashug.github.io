Hi, I'm a PhD student in Machine Learning at
[IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/?lang=en) lab, France. I'm also the main developer
of [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/), an open source Python library for
building recommender systems.

In a near future (summer 2017), I'll be looking for a job. If you want to know
more about me, please check out my [resume]({{site.base.url}}/resume.html)!
